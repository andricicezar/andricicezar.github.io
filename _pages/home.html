<p>I’m a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://mpi-sp.org">MPI-SP</a>, Bochum, Germany working with Cătălin Hriţcu.
My research focuses on building the first secure compiler for verified code, by developing a secure compiler from the proof-oriented programming language F* to OCaml.
Existing (insecure) compilers erase all the annotations with which the code was verified, thus, making the resulting compiled code vulnerable when linked against adversarial code. 
To fix this, a secure compiler exploits available mechanisms to enforce the assumptions made in the annotations. In my most recent paper, POPL’24, we present a secure compiler for verified IO programs that converts the assumptions into dynamic checks.</p>
