<p>I’m a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://mpi-sp.org">MPI-SP</a>, Bochum, Germany working with Cătălin Hriţcu.
My research focuses on building the first secure compiler for verified code, by developing a secure compiler from the proof-oriented programming language F<sup>*</sup> to OCaml.
Existing (insecure) compilers erase all the annotations with which the code was verified, thus, making the resulting compiled code vulnerable when linked against adversarial code.</p>

	<li>Looking for Dijkstra Monads to practically verify that terminating, non-terminating or concurrent programs satisfy trace properties. Maybe even hyperproperties?</li>
	<li>Secure compilation of verfied code in F*</li>
